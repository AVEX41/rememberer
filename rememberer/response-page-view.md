To achieve your desired functionality, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a SwiftUI view to display the tasks for a selected page. Let's call it `TaskListView`.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct TaskListView: View {
    let page: Page

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Tasks for \(page.name)")
                .font(.title)
            
            List(page.tasks) { task in
                Text(task.name)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Modify your main content view to navigate to the `TaskListView` when a page is clicked. Assuming you have a model or view model to store the pages and tasks, you can update your content view as follows:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ContentViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(viewModel.pages) { page in
                NavigationLink(destination: TaskListView(page: page)) {
                    Text(page.name)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Pages")
        }
    }
}
```

3. Update your data model or view model to include the necessary entities, such as `Page` and `Task`. Make sure the `Page` entity has a property to store the associated tasks.

Here's an example of how your data model might look:

```swift
struct Page: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    var tasks: [Task]
}

struct Task: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
}

class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var pages: [Page] = []

    init() {
        // Populate pages and tasks data
        let task1 = Task(id: UUID(), name: "Task 1")
        let task2 = Task(id: UUID(), name: "Task 2")
        let page1 = Page(id: UUID(), name: "Page 1", tasks: [task1, task2])
        let task3 = Task(id: UUID(), name: "Task 3")
        let task4 = Task(id: UUID(), name: "Task 4")
        let page2 = Page(id: UUID(), name: "Page 2", tasks: [task3, task4])

        pages = [page1, page2]
    }
}
```

With these changes, when you click on a page in your main content view, it will navigate to the `TaskListView` and display the associated tasks for that page.
